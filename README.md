# Fraud-Detection
Generated fraud detection in Instant Payment Systems using multiple machine learning approaches (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised)

# 💳 Fraud Detection in Instant Payment Systems

This project demonstrates **real-time fraud detection** in Instant Payment Systems using **machine learning**.  
It features **supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised** models, allowing users to compare accuracy, detection time, and overall performance.  
The app is built with **Streamlit** and simulates a live transaction stream for interactive testing.
