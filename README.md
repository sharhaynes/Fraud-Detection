# Fraud Detection in Instant Payment Systems

This project demonstrates real-time fraud detection in Instant Payment Systems (IPS) using **machine learning**.  
It implements supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised models to compare accuracy, detection time, and overall performance.  
The application is built with Streamlit and uses simulated transaction data to replicate a live streaming environment.

---

## Overview

The system evaluates multiple machine learning approaches for identifying fraudulent transactions in IPS data.  
Users can upload datasets, train models, visualize performance metrics, and measure detection time across models.

---

## Features

- Evaluation of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised models  
- Comparison of model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC  
- Measurement of detection time per transaction (based on simulation steps)  
- Visualization of confusion matrices and ROC curves  
- Streamlit-based interactive interface for model testing and analysis  
- Synthetic data generation for simulation and benchmarking  

---
##How Project Works
1. Generate datasets using the scripts in `generate_data`.  
   - These scripts output CSV files representing simulated transaction data.  
2. Run the Streamlit app to test the models using the generated data.  
   - Each app (supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised) can be run independently.
