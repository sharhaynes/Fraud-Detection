# Fraud Detection in Instant Payment Systems

This project demonstrates **real-time fraud detection** in Instant Payment Systems (IPS) using **machine learning**.  
It implements **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **semi-supervised** models to compare accuracy, detection time, and overall performance.  
The application is built with **Streamlit** and uses simulated transaction data to replicate a live streaming environment.

## Overview

The system evaluates multiple machine learning approaches for identifying fraudulent transactions in IPS data.  
Users can upload datasets, train models, visualize performance metrics, and measure detection time across models.

## Features

- Evaluation of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised models  
- Comparison of model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC  
- Measurement of detection time per transaction (based on simulation steps)  
- Visualization of confusion matrices and ROC curves  
- Streamlit-based interactive interface for model testing and analysis  
- Synthetic data generation for simulation and benchmarking
